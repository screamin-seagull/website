            <p><b>Languages:</b> Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used
            to create this website
            <br><br><b>Framework:</b> This website was built on the Flask web framework for Python
            <br><br><b>Hosting:</b> PythonAnywhere.com provides the hosting server for this website, which
            I manually configured to work with Flask
            <br><br><b>Future Plans:</b>  A few current projects that I host here are still incomplete, and I intend
            to host any other things I think of later on here, too

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p><b>Description:</b> This is a web scraper I created that retrieves the name and image
                of a bird from its page on ebird.org. Currently it only retrieves birds at random
                <br><br><b>Technical:</b> This app accesses the "Surprise Me!" button from ebird.org's
                Explore page then uses the BeautifulSoup library to search for and retrieve the needed information
                <br><br><b>Future Plans:</b> Currently a random bird is displayed each time the homepage is loaded.
                I would like to set it up as a "Bird of the Day" that updates once every 24 hours instead. Additionally,
                I'll likely add some functions to the class to get more information besides just name and image

            <p><b>Description:</b> This was a way to dip my toes back into genetic algorithms with something simple.
                You just enter a number, click "Run", and a genetic algorithm will run that creates generations of semi-random
                guesses. Once it finishes, it tells you how long it takes to guess correctly and displays the generations
                <br><br><b>Technical:</b> When a number is entered and the app is run, the algorithm will generate the first
                generation completely randomly. (While the guesser class is set up to have a variable generation size, the version
                hosted here currently only uses generations of 20.) Each of the guesses in this generation are then assigned a
                "fitness" rating proportional to how close they are to your number. At this point the guesses with the best fitness
                scores (also variable, but top 5 in this case) are chosen to create the next generation. This is accomplished by
                taking these numbers and adding random mutations in the form of adding or subtracting from them within a given range
                (in this case, mutations randomly add a number between -5 and +5). This process repeats, each generation getting more
                accurate, until your number is guessed successfully
                <br><br><b>Future Plans:</b> This is more of a proof of concept than a practical application, but it has opened up
                a lot of ideas for machine learning. Eventually I'll add the ability to change the variables for generation size,
                mutation range, and number of reproducers. Once that's completed, I'm going to look into creating a Tic Tac Toe AI
                that learns through a genetic algorithm and by playing against users on the website

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p><b>Description:</b> A tool to help organize Magic: the Gathering "cubes". Cubes are custom sets of cards that are
                kept together and used to draft and build decks to play against each other. Building a properly balanced cube requires
                the designer to be able to view statistics about the details of the cards that are being chosen. For example, what
                color the card is and what strategies it fits into
                <br><br><b>Technical:</b> Cube info is stored as dictionaries in .xlsx files. Card information is retrieved from Scryfall.com
                using their API and the Scrython library for Python
                <br><br><b>Future Plans:</b> This app is still a work in progress and is largely non-functional
